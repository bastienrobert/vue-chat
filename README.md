# Vue Chat

Socket and VueJS chat.

## How it works?

For now, it works.

That's all!

## Build

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
